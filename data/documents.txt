Metformin is the recommended first line pharmacological treatment for type 2 diabetes.
Metformin improves insulin sensitivity and reduces hepatic glucose production.
Lifestyle modification including diet, exercise, and weight management is recommended for managing type 2 diabetes.
Lifestyle modification alone may not be sufficient for long-term glycemic control in all patients.
Insulin therapy may be required in advanced, uncontrolled, or high-risk type 2 diabetes cases.
Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition that can lead to long-term complications if not adequately managed.
Combining ACE inhibitors and ARBs is not recommended due to increased risk of kidney injury and hyperkalemia.
No single treatment guarantees permanent remission of type 2 diabetes for all patients.
